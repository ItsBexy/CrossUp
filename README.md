# CrossUp (Test Release)

This plugin adds several customization options to FFXIV's main Gamepad interface, the Cross Hotbar.

## Current Features

* Split up the Left/Right Cross Hotbars, allowing for other UI elements (such as job gauges or the minimap) to be placed in the centre between them.
* Edit the highlight colour for the currently-selected bar, or hide the highlight backdrop entirely
* Edit positions of individual Cross Hotbar elements
* Display the Expanded Hold Controls as their own UI element, fully separate from the main hotbar
	* NOTE: This feature requires you to select two of your mouse/keyboard hotbars for the plugin to "borrow". It will then rearrange the buttons from those bars to appear as part of the Cross Hotbar. The contents of the bars will not be overwritten, but they will be unavailable while the feature is active.
* Configure the assignments for the WXHB and Expanded Hold Controls to dynamically change, based on the currently-selected Cross Hotbar Set

## Potential/Planned Features

* "Hide Unassigned Slots" option, like the one that exists for mouse/kb hotbars
* More colour customization (ie, the glow frame whenever a button is pressed)
